    "## Why Iteration?\n",
    "Iteration in Python is one of the most powerful tools in the language. It allows you to repeat a block of code a certain number of times, or until a certain condition is met. There are two types of iteration in Python: for loops and while loops. For loops are generally used when you know how many times you want to repeat a block of code. While loops are generally used when you don't know how many times you want to repeat a block of code.\n",

    "## For Loops \n",
    "To get started, lets focus on for loops. For loops are used when you have a definite number of times you want to repeat a block of code. For example, if you wanted to print the numbers 1 through 10, you could do the following:\n"
